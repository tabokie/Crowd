# Crowd

Crowd is a system monitor with Java UI widget designed to better illustrate `replication`, `workflow`, `shared data` and other de-centralized system feature. It provides series of duplex ports through which working status can be transferred from extensive systems, including multi-pass worker, multi-process application, network cluster.

Also, for educational cause, it carries a compact distributed system simulator which demonstrates the monitor without connecting to large-scale network cluster.

This project is currently under development.

## Crowd UI

Mostly inspired by [Ambrose](https://github.com/twitter/ambrose), Crowd UI is implemented with JavaFX, and provides following widget in a windows application:

* Workflow keeps track of overall working dependency between nodes and report the current progress.

* Replicated Node contains several real nodes to compose a crash-tolerant super node, which then be treated as single node in Workflow.

Here is a screenshot of alpha version UI:

## Crowd Simulator

Crowd deploy simulated nodes based on `Crowd Script`, which provide expressive way of designing custom distributed protocol.

During runtime, script is dynamicly compiled and instantiated into new nodes. To constraint the simulation thread amount in a controllable limit, simulator employs a main scheduler thread that receives discrete time events and schedules them onto fixed amount of sub-thread workers. Both real-time and speculative simulation driver are for option when running.

Once the monitor is launched, user can start predefined simulation task or create new node with Crowd Script dynamically.

Currently support algorithm:

* [ ] Lamport clock
* [ ] 2PC

## Crowd Port

Apart from simulation on single machine, Crowd is designed to fit the needs of various parallel task, including processes, network neighbors.

Solutions include network communication, shared memory.

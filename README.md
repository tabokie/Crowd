# Crowd

Crowd is a system monitor with Java UI widget designed to better illustrate `replication`, `workflow`, `shared data` and other de-centralized system. It provides series of duplex ports through which working status can be transferred from extensive systems, including multi-pass worker, multi-process application, network cluster.

Also, for educational cause, it carries a compact distribuetd system simulator which demonstrates the monitor without connecting to large-scale network cluster.

This project is currently under development.
